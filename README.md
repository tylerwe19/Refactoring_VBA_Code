# Refactoring_VBA_Code

## Overview of Project

This project helps the viewer understand how various have performed throughout 2017 and 2018. This project shows the total daily volume for each ticker throughout each year and also compares how each stock's trading price started out the year to how the stock price concluded the year. This comparison is summarized in the stock's Return Rate.

### Purpose

This project is intended to visualize each stock's Total Daily Volume and Return Rate throughout 2017 and 2018. Through this analysis the viewer can identify which stocks have performed well and are worth investing in. Another goal of this project is to refactor the VBA code to become more efficient so it can handle a comparison of thousands of different stocks. 

### Results
As we'll see the overall performance of the sample of stocks was better in 2017 than in 2018. Based off of this sample of stocks, it appears the market went from bullish to bearish. 

 * As seen, in 2017 nearly all stocks had a positive return rate.

 * Unfortunately in 2018 a majority of stocks experienced a negative return rate.

 * However, the RUN ticker should be noted. During the Bull market of 2017 they had a meager 5.5% return rate, but during the bear market of 2018 RUN had a 84% return rate, being the only stock to increase it's return rate from 2017 to 2018.

### Summary
The company with the RUN ticker is on the rise and viewers should consider investing in this company as long as they didn't peak in 2018 or if 2018 was an anomaly for this company. Additionally, as seen above the VBA has been refactored to be more efficient and runs twice as fast as the module we initially created throughout Module 2.

 1. Refactoring code helps the macro become more efficient so it can run more quickly and handle more data. It also makes the code cleaner and easier to understand. The difficulty of refactoring code is it takes more time for the developer to figure out how to make it more efficient. It takes time to learn and apply more advanced skills and it takes time trying to figure out how to make it more efficient. 
 2. The above pros and cons about refactoring VBA definitely apply to this project. It was challenging for me in trying to refactor the VBA script. We used a few different functions/calculations that I was not as comfortable with. Therefore, I needed assistance to complete this project. However, after refactoring the VBA script it did make the macro run twice as fast as it initially did - maybe even faster.
